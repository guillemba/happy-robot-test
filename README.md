# happy-robot-test

This repository contains the code and documentation for the FDE Technical Challenge, implementing an inbound carrier engagement use case using the HappyRobot platform.

## üì¶ Project Goals & Overview

The primary objective was to create an AI assistant capable of receiving calls from carriers looking to book loads. This solution integrates HappyRobot's AI capabilities with custom APIs and a dashboard for metrics.

### Key Features Implemented:
*   **Carrier Verification:** AI assistant obtains MC number and verifies eligibility.
*   **Load Search & Pitch:** AI searches for available loads (via custom API) and pitches details to the carrier.
*   **Offer Negotiation:** Handles up to 3 rounds of counter-offer negotiation.
*   **Call Transfer:** Transfers call to a sales representative upon price agreement.
*   **Data Extraction & Classification:** Extracts relevant offer data, classifies call outcome, and carrier sentiment.
*   **Metrics Dashboard:** A simple web application to track call metrics.

## üèõ Architecture

The solution comprises the following components:

1.  **HappyRobot AI Assistant Workflow:** (Link to HappyRobot campaign: [https://platform.happyrobot.ai/deployments/15hz6oyw8snm/jz360tiejic6])
    *   Manages the call flow, AI conversation, and triggers webhooks/API calls.
    *   Configured to use the Web Call feature.

2.  **Load API (Google Cloud Function):**
    *   A serverless function hosted on Google Cloud Platform that acts as the backend for:
        *   Simulating load searches (reading from a file/DB context).
    *   Deployment Region: `[europe-southwest1]`
    *   Endpoint: `[https://fake-api-138884064989.europe-southwest1.run.app]`
    *   Authentication: Via API Key

3.  **Metrics Dashboard (Replit Web/App):**
    *   A simple web application for tracking call outcomes, sentiment, and other metrics.
    *   Receives data via webhooks from the HappyRobot workflow.
    *   Deployed on: `[Replit]`
    *   Endpoint: `[https://call-tracker-dashboard-gbalcells93.replit.app]`
    *   Endpoint (POST /new-call): `[https://call-tracker-dashboard-gbalcells93.replit.app/new-call]`
    *   Endpoint (POST /deals): `[https://call-tracker-dashboard-gbalcells93.replit.app/deals]`
    *   Endpoint (POST /sentiment): `[https://call-tracker-dashboard-gbalcells93.replit.app/sentiment]`
  
## End notes    
*   Because I'm based in Barcelona (Spain) my IP is not allowed to interact with the FMCSA API as it's out of the US. My workaround has been to hardcode in the System prompt in the Happy Robot Workflow to fake an MC Number check.
